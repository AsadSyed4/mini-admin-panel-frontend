## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the application.
  - `src/components/`: Vue components for different parts of the application.
  - `src/views/`: Vue views for various pages.
  - `src/router/`: Vue Router setup and routing configuration.
  - `src/composables/userSession/`: Application state management using Pinia.
  - `src/composables/useApi/`: API calls and Axios configurations.
- `public/`: Static assets.
- `vite.config.ts`: Vite configuration file.
